# EU eHealthNetwork Digitial COVID Certificate value sets

This repository contains the value sets referenced by the EU Digital COVID Certificate (DCC) [JSON Schema](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/ehn-dcc-schema).

Release: 2.6.0

Note that these value sets do not form a core part of the [JSON Schema](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/ehn-dcc-schema) but are referenced by it. These value sets can (and should) be regularly updated and distributed from the main Digital COVID Certificate Gateway (DCCG), under clear versioning and release management.

This repository has been created to provide a home for the value sets (for development purposes only) which have up until now (2021-06-16) been living a somewhat orphaned life in the [JSON Schema](https://github.com/ehn-dcc-development/ehn-dcc-schema) repository.
